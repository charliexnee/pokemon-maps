        <p>Our project attempts to visualize places in a way that is both informative and fun, hoping to allow people to see mundane places with a new sense of wonder. We took inspiration from the popular franchise Pokemon. Every few years, Pokemon releases a new ‘generation’ which, among other things, contains a new ‘region’, or a fictional setting that is separate from but within the same universe as other regions. Each of these regions are heavily based off of real-world areas, with some changes. Our goal was to create these types of regions, but changing much less than the original games. This included defining landmarks to serve the function that cities and towns do in the games, draw simple, straightforward routes that connect them, and displaying various Pokemon to represent actual animal species that can be found in the area. Our area of study includes one map of mainland Southeast Asia (including Singapore) and one map focused entirely on Singapore.</p>
